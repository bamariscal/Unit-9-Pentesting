# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1:I had to figure out the session ID for the website, however, I was able to do a Session Hijack with a different browser by figuring out the session ID of the logged in user. I used Google Chrome and Internet Expolorer for my browsers. The attacker in the internet explorer was able to gain access to admin privilages.

Vulnerability #2: Salesperson Sanuel Hunter has a vulnerability when performing an SQL injection to the end of the URL. I added ' OR SLEEP(5)=0--' and when I did, another members profile was displayed. The developer did not check vulnerabilities in the URL input
