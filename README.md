# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking/Fixation

Description: I had to figure out the session ID for the website, however, I was able to do a Session Hijack with a different browser by figuring out the session ID of the logged in user. I used Google Chrome and Internet Expolorer for my browsers. The attacker in the internet explorer was able to gain access to admin privilages.

Vulnerability #2: SQL Injection (SQLi)

Description: Salesperson Sanuel Hunter has a vulnerability when performing an SQL injection to the end of the URL. I added ' OR SLEEP(3)=0--' and when I did, another members profile was displayed. The developer did not check vulnerabilities in the URL input

## Green

Vulnerability #1: User Enumeration

Description: When typing in the wrong username, the error was not bolted and in the inspect window the string would come out as "failed", yet when typed in the right useranem, the error would be bolted and the inspect window would say "failure". This is a vulnerability since it can show which usernames are valid.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Description: The attacker injects a JavaScipt into the name and it is executed when the admin checks the feedback tab. The JavaScript attack I injected is <script>alert(‘Bryan’)</script>
